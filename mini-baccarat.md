The player and banker hands are each dealt two cards. If either the player or banker hand, or both, achieve a total of 8 or 9 with the first two cards (known as a "natural"), the coup is finished and the result is announced: player wins, banker wins, or tie. Natural 9 beats natural 8. If neither the player nor banker hand is dealt a total of 8 or 9 in the first two cards, the tableau is consulted, first for the player rules, then the banker rules.

Player's rules If the player hand has an initial total of 0–5, a third card is dealt. If the player hand has an initial total of 6 or 7, it stands. Banker's rule If the player stood pat (i.e., has only two cards), the banker acts according to the same rules as the player. That means the banker draws a third card with hands 0–5 and stands with 6 or 7. If the player hand drew a third card, the banker acts according to the following more complex rules:

If the banker total is 2 or less, then the banker draws a card, regardless of what the player's third card is. If the banker total is 3, then the bank draws a third card unless the player's third card was an 8. If the banker total is 4, then the bank draws a third card if the player's third card was 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. If the banker total is 5, then the bank draws a third card if the player's third card was 4, 5, 6, or 7. If the banker total is 6, then the bank draws a third card if the player's third card was a 6 or 7. If the banker total is 7, then the banker stands.[6][7]
